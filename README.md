#GUESS MY NUMBER
This is a simple number guessing game. The computer will generate a random number between 1 and 100. The user will have to guess the number. The computer will tell the user if their guess is too high or too low. The user will keep guessing until they guess the correct number. The computer will then tell the user how many guesses it took to guess the correct number.
